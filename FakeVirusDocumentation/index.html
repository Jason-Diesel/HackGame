    <h1>Fake Virus</h1>
    <h2>Information</h2>
    <p>
        Different viruses have been injected into your computer. <br>
        You need to stop these viruses before it's too late, and they take control of your system. <br>
        Some viruses seek to corrupt your files, some wanna take over your whole computer while some just wanna troll you and make you mad.<br>
        I've gathered information about the various types of viruses on your computer and how to eliminate them. <br>
        There are six different kinds of viruses:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Ad Virus</li>
            <li>Cryptate Virus</li>
            <li>Matrix File Virus</li>
            <li>Mouse Movement Virus</li>
            <li>Will not close Virus</li>
            <li>Mouse Virus</li>
          </ul> 
        Each with different threat levels from 0 to 5, where 0 is no threat at all and 5 is it kills your computer.<br>
        Here how to deal with them: 
        
    </p>

    <div class="virus">
        <h3>Ad Virus, Threat Level : 0</h3>
        <h4>Info:</h4>
        <p>
            A ad virus that shows an ad on the lovely, sexy, beautiful turtle vedal987.<br>
            This virus is not harmful and will not destroy your computer but is needed to be removed to continue.
        </p>
        <h4>How to remove:</h4>
        <p>Press the close button...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="virus">
        <h3>Cryptate Virus, Threat Level : 5</h3>
        <h4>Info:</h4>
        <p>The grandchild of CryptoLocker. The virus uses a cryptation to do a count down, when the count down is at 0, all of the computers files will be locked.</p>
        <h4>How to remove:</h4>
        <p>
            Beacuse it's the grandchild of cryptolocker the cryptation is very easy to decrypt, a program called "DecryptFakeHack" will be able to decrypt the whole 
            thing in seconds. <br> Just write the first two digits to the program and then the rest of the characters. Remember to only use upper case letters or it will not work!
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="virus">
        <h3>Matrix File Virus, Threat Level : 4</h3>
        <h4>Info:</h4>
        <p>
           A virus that adds a special file to your computer, and needs to be rewritten correctly or it will "hack" you.
        </p>
        <h4>How to remove:</h4>
        <p>
            Try to find the FileCheckerFakeVirus_&lt;a number&gt;_.txt file. Somewhere in the file it will say "EULA = FALSE" change it to "EULA = TRUE".
            <br>Do not change anything more or it might not work.
            <br>You can find the word faster if you press CTRL+F and search for "EULA = FALSE" and it will take you directly to the word.
